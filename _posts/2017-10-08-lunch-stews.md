I like bringing my lunch to work to eat healthier and be thriftier, but I don't
like making my lunch in the morning because I feel rushed for time.

The last couple weeks I've tried making a stew on the weekend and eating it for
my lunches and that's worked great.  I made a [Moroccan veggie
stew](https://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/11/moroccan-lentil-vegetable-stew/),
which was pretty good, and
[chili](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016036-texas-chili), which was
awesome.

For this week's lunches I made a veggie stew inspired by
[these](https://www.delishknowledge.com/turmeric-red-lentil-soup/)
[online](http://www.eatwell101.com/carrot-turmeric-red-lentil-stew-recipe)
[recipes](https://www.delishknowledge.com/turmeric-red-lentil-soup/).

I sauteed in olive oil:
- 1 yellow onion
- 3 carrots, sliced
- 3 celery stalks, sliced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced

added these spices:
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp ceylon (lighter flavor) cinnamon
- 1 tsp cumin
- 4 cardamom pods, ground
- 1/4 tsp cayenne

sauteed for a minute before adding:
- 28oz can diced tomatoes
- 15oz can coconut milk
- 1 quart veggie broth

brought to a boil and added:
- 1 cup red lentils

reduced heat to simmer, simmered 10 minutes, and added:
- 2 pac choi, chopped up

simmered 10 minutes and added:
- 2 cups baby kale

simmered 5 minutes, adjusted salt, and done.

It turned out great!  Coconut milk makes things delicious :)  I also like
that the stews are flexible enough that I can add in whatever leftover veggies
I have (pac choi and kale this time).

What do you do for lunch?  Do you have any tasty, easy, healthy lunch
suggestions?
