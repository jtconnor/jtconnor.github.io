title:  "Overdue Apologies"
---
I was talking with someone about how people can be really mean in high school
and remembered the uncomfortable truth that I was mean to people in high
school.  I felt bad and wished that I'd been better.   I thought about
apologizing to people I'd been mean to and was on the fence about whether
that'd be kind or just self-serving.  I decided to go ahead and apologize and
sent messages to a couple people I'd been mean to.  I was surprised by their
replies:

> James, thank you very much for your words. It means a lot to me no matter
> when it was said. Apology accepted. I am doing well and I hope you are too.

and

> No problem we were all kids <br>
> Hope you are doing well

Sounds like the apology really meant something to one person and hardly
anything to the other.  I wouldn't have guessed.

I'm also glad that I apologized.  It felt like part of fully owning up to what
I did.
