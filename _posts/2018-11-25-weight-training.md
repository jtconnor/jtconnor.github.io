title:  "Weight Training"
---
I've been lifting weights for the last couple years and it's been fun working
on getting stronger and getting to take peaceful breaks for exercise.

Weight training gives a different sort of challenge for my body than more
repetitive exercise and there's a focus on progress (vs. fitness
classes where I get a good sweat but don't feel like I'm progressing).

I started weight training by following Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength
program
([book](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-Basic-Barbell-Training/dp/0982522738/),
[online](https://startingstrength.com/get-started/programs)).  The workouts are
simple and there's lots of emphasis on good form ([form
videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/AasgaardCo/playlists?shelf_id=13&view=50&sort=dd)).

After about 9 months of semi-consistently following Starting Strength, I
stopped getting stronger and (thanks to my friend Susanna's recommendation)
switched to Wendler's 5/3/1 program ([book that I
got](https://www.amazon.com/Simplest-Effective-Training-System-Strength/dp/B00686OYGQ/),
[newer book that I haven't
read](https://jimwendler.com/products/5-3-1-forever-book),
[online](https://www.lift.net/workout-routines/wendler-5-3-1/)).  And after a
few months of that I stopped training bench and military press because my right
shoulder was feeling weird and I found out that I have a torn rotator cuff and
labrum (old injury) and figured I'd rather not stress out my shoulder.  Now I
warm up with the [Agile 8](https://www.t-nation.com/training/defranco-agile-8),
do the main lift of the day, and then do bodyweight assistance exercises (on
squat day, single leg step ups to a box and pull/chin ups; on deadlift day,
glute hamstring raises).  I document every workout in a training log and use a
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EfMGPI7LKgw4Tvxhn9UFRKzLjUGcTdA0hgg9wnrbpWw/edit?usp=sharing)
to calculate 5/3/1 percentages and draw graphs to show my progress.
