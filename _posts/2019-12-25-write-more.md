title:  "Write More (#1)"
---
I'd like to write more but I'm an uncomfortable and slow writer and often don't
get around to actually writing.  I read a recommendation that one way to
improve as a writer is to just write 100 articles and I'm going to try doing
that by the end of 2020.  This is article #1.
