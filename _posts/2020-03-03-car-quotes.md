title:  "Car Quotes (#4)"
---
I was at a car dealership today where they’d created posters with car-related
quotes.  I think the quotes were intended to be inspirational but came off more
as a sobering commentary on car consumerism.  I wonder if the person who
created the posters was trolling, copy-pasted from wikiquote without
thinking about what the quotes mean, or ?
