title:  "Speaking Fee Bribery"
---
Let's say I'm Goldman Sachs and I want to bribe the Treasury Secretary.  I'd be
happy to pay the Treasury Secretary directly but, though I may be rapacious and
corrupt, I'm also risk averse and don't want to be [caught and
punished](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-charged-foreign-bribery-case-and-agrees-pay-over-29-billion){:target="_blank"}. 

I could disguise my scheme by promising to pay the Treasury Secretary only
after they leave office.  Then the bribery would be less obvious but I'd still
risk getting in trouble if my promise ever came to light.

I have a better idea.  I'll build a track record of paying former government
officials if they treated me well when they were in office (for example: [Janet
Yellen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/01/01/yellen-earned-72-million-in-speaking-fees-over-last-two-years/){:target="_blank"},
[Ben
Bernanke](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2014/05/25/ben-bernankes-post-fed-speaking-fees-send-a-scary-economic-message/){:target="_blank"},
[Bill and Hillary
Clinton](https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-paid-speeches/index.html){:target="_blank"}).
Then the Treasury Secretary will know that if they do what I want, they'll get
a big bribe after they leave office.  And because there's no explicit quid pro
quo, even if I'm caught, I won't get in any trouble.  I'll just say the payment
was a speaking fee.  If anyone objects, I can point to all the other speaking
fee bribes I've paid to former government officials as evidence that [these
speaking fees are
standard](https://twitter.com/SRuhle/status/1345085488219246593){:target="_blank"}.

It's trickier to outlaw speaking fee bribery than to outlaw direct bribery
because there's plausible deniability.  It's at least conceivable that the
speaking fees are payments for speeches.  We also don't want to penalize former
government officials for their public service by preventing them from working
or earning money after their time in office.  Still, bribery is so destructive
to government function and public trust that we should disallow speaking fee
bribery even if doing so would limit conceivably legitimate work like [Janet
Yellen making $292,500 from her 10/17/2019 speech at Citadel](https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/C22B882BBDC40AC78525864F008106AB/$FILE/Yellen,%20Janet%20L.%20AMENDEDfinal%20278.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

We could use the following criterion, which attempts to disallow speaking fee
bribery while still allowing legitimate work:  If a reasonable person would
think that a work payment (speaking fee, consulting fee, job salary, etc.) that
a company pays to a former government official is:
* likely affected by how that official's actions in office affected that
particular company,
* substantially different from work payments the official received before holding office, and
* substantially different from work payments received by the official's peers that haven't served in government,
then the former government official shouldn't be allowed to accept that work payment.

This criterion would disallow Yellen's speaking fees after leaving office because they're:
* likely affected by how her actions affected Wall Street while she was in office.  If Yellen had been a thorn in the side of Wall Street while in office, it's unlikely that Wall Street would be raining money on her to visit and speak.
* substantially more expensive, numerous, and corporate than her previous work [1], and
* substantially more expensive and numerous than speaking fees for peers that haven't served in government.

Here are some potential objections and responses:

1. Objection: Janet Yellen is a dedicated civil servant who, to the best of her
ability, acted in the public interest while in office.  Her actions in office
weren't affected by the prospect of any potential future speaking fees.  Now
that she's an in-demand speaker, we shouldn't punish her for her public service
by not allowing her to accept payment for her work.

   Response: While in office, Yellen would have known that if she made Wall Street happy
she could expect to make a lot of money in the future in speaking fees (like
[Ben
Bernanke](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2014/05/25/ben-bernankes-post-fed-speaking-fees-send-a-scary-economic-message/?sh=54b67d90661e){:target="_blank"}
before her). Would that knowledge have affected her behavior in office? Well,
we know she's at least somewhat motivated by money. [She spent her last two
years raking in $7 million across more than 50
speeches](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/01/janet-yellen-speaking-fees-us-treasury-secretary){:target="_blank"}
. And it doesn't seem like the public interest is her sole motivation. If she
cared solely about the public interest and thought her speeches were worth
~200k apiece, she could have greatly benefited the public by posting her
speeches to youtube and saved herself the time and effort globetrotting.

   She very well may have acted solely in the public interest while in office.
But the prospect of future speaking fees seems like it could influence an
official's actions and this kind of influence is so awful that we should
disallow it.

1. Objection: Wall Street pays Janet Yellen exorbitant speaking fees, not as a
bribe for her past actions in office, but in order to gain valuable insight
into current and future Fed policy.

   Response: Former government officials making money off of non-public information they
gained while in office seems like its own, separate problem.

1. Objection: [Janet Yellen made about $200,000 in salary as Fed
Chair](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/salary-federal-reserve-chairman/){:target="_blank"}
, which is vastly underpaid for the importance and value of that position.
Wall Street pays Janet Yellen exorbitant speaking fees, not as a bribe for
her past actions in office, but in order to make up for her being underpaid
in office.

   Response: We should pay key government officials well and fairly so that exorbitant
speaking fees after leaving office aren't necessary for fair compensation.  We
should also disallow speaking fee bribery.  These goals aren't mutually
exclusive.
